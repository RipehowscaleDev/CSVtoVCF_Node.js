it all started with a python script that worked at first but was unable to parse // / '//' <> 
so i decided to turn it into a node js script
the description of the library utilities is inside each file enjoy its just a little partially working library
but its a foundationd solid enough to experiment csv to vcf

its working with android vcf files and windows vcf files hasnt tried it on ubuntu although im an ubuntu lover

should work on both platform



mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm init -y

npm install csv-parser

npm install vcards-js
